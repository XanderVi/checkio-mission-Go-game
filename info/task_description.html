<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Few years ago, at the spring 2016, some unbelievable event has happend - the computer program <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo'>AlphaGo</a>, developed by Google DeepMind, has won against the world best player in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)'>Go game</a> with the result 4-1. Until the last moment nobody believed that the computer is can be stronger than a man in the ancient Japanese game, in which the amount of possible variants is greater then the amount of all atoms in the whole Universe!<br>
<br>
Unlike chess, where every player has the full set of the figures on the 8x8 board at the beginning of the game, and can analyse all moves with only the pure estimation, in Go game such strategy doesn't work. At the first, in this game is used board which is almost in 6 time greater, than chessboard - 361 gamepoint against only 64 in the chess. At the second, the game begins with absolutely empty board and the main part of good moves are intuition and sense of harmony stone placement, till the middle of the game.<br>
Despite this, with the help of machine learning and the huge number of games AlphaGo has played with itself, the program has become stronger than a man.

<p>
In this mission you will learn the basic rules of the Go game and will learn how to analyze the board situation. Here are a few rules:<br>
- 2 man plays with stones (game figures) of different colors<br>
- the stones is put on the intersections<br>
- every stone or group of the stones has 'liberties' - dame (traditional Japanese word for this term). This is the points which contact with stone/group horizontally and vertically<br>
- the whole group is a group of the stones which contact each other horizontally and vertically. The group has mutual liberties<br>
- if the all liberties of the stone or group are blocked/closed by the stones of the other player - this stones are "eaten" and remove from the board<br>
Here is some demonstration of the 'liberties' concept.

</p>

<p>
In this mission your task is to count how many stones of each color were 'eaten'.
The input will be two-dimensional array - the list of the strings, where the empty intersections will be '+', the black stones - 'B' and the white stones - 'W' (black & white are traditional colors for this game). You should return the answer in the dictionary format, like this: {'B': n, 'W': m}, where n and m - the amount of black and white stones which were 'eated'. For example, if there were eaten 3 black stones, and 4 white, the answer will be: {'B': 3, 'W': 4}.
